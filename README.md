## Project Overview
In this project on **TryHackMe**, I analyzed a suspicious email to detect potential phishing attacks.  
The investigation involved examining email headers to identify spoofed sender information, investigating embedded links and attachments to determine malicious intent, and identifying attacker infrastructure.  
The alert was validated as a confirmed phishing attempt.
